Note to self:
1. When changing pq to array, array wil not be in sequence
2. When polling especially in to string method might cause it to empty the pq and thus leading to an
empty pq
3.Do not load a pq to arraylist twice if method is gonna call the obj twice
4.To have compare work with two types of object but yet you dont want compare one type of the object, store
it in another data structure
4. Try to print a pq by polling instead of changing it to array cos of 1
5.Becareful of if else espcially else
Eg: 
the following 

for(Menuitem i: arr){
    
    if(i.getID ==5){
        return 5;
        }
    else{
        return 0;
        }
    }

this will return a 0 if cant find which is truoublesome, do not add a else if not necessary
6. set integer to states so compareto will be easier
7. Print a queue by creating a method with a temporary queue
8. when using exception, rmb to reroll exception
